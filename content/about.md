## Hello！ 👋

I'm Nanxuan Li, and this is my little corner of the internet where I share thoughts, projects, and things I find interesting.



### Who Am I
I'm a developer who loves building things with code. By day, I work on software that aims to make life a bit easier; by night, I'm either learning a new framework, analyzing market trends, or getting lost in a virtual world. I believe in continuous learning and the power of technology to create positive change.
### Hobbies
- Programming – I enjoy crafting clean code, exploring new languages, and contributing to open source.

- Stock Market – I'm fascinated by financial markets, value investing, and the psychology behind trading. Always looking for the next insight.

- Gaming – From strategy games to immersive RPGs, gaming is my way to unwind and sometimes even find inspiration for problem-solving.
